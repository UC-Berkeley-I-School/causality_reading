# Look at Civic Duty Effect

The main result reported in the paper is the effect of civic duty. Begin
by replicating this effect on the current data.

``` r
SUBSET <- c(' Civic Duty', ' Control')

d_individual[treatment %in% SUBSET][
  , .(mean_vote = mean(voted == 'Yes'), 
      sem       = sqrt( (var(voted == 'Yes')) / .N)), by = .(treatment)]
```

    ##      treatment mean_vote         sem
    ## 1:     Control 0.2946787 0.001930403
    ## 2:  Civic Duty 0.3123752 0.004414724

``` r
d_individual[treatment %in% SUBSET][ 
  , t.test(voted == 'Yes' ~ treatment)]
```

    ## 
    ##  Welch Two Sample t-test
    ## 
    ## data:  voted == "Yes" by treatment
    ## t = 3.6728, df = 15526, p-value = 0.0002408
    ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group  Civic Duty and group  Control is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  0.008252057 0.027141012
    ## sample estimates:
    ## mean in group  Civic Duty    mean in group  Control 
    ##                 0.3123752                 0.2946787

So, yes, weâ€™re seeing the same effect as was reported.

```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

    ## Warning: Removed 33202 rows containing non-finite values (stat_smooth).

    ## Warning: Removed 33202 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
