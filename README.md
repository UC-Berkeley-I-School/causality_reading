This repository supports the "Causality Reading Group" that meets generally every other Monday, at 12:00pm Pacific Time, at [this room](berkeley.zoom.us/my/dalex). Coordination happens in the #field-experiments channel of the ISchool Slack.

## Recursive Partitioning for Heterogeneous Causal Effects 

[[This paper]](./papers/athey_imbens_2016.pdf) is by Athey and Imbens (2016), and is the starting point for a line of research that is taken up with Stephan Wager and others.
